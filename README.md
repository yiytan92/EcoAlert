# EcoAlert
App definition statement 
My App’s purpose is for its users to report an environmental problem or potential environmental improvement based on their surrounding location. I think it will be useful, because environmentalists are motivated to tackle these problems like cleaning up a beach or encourage recycling and the app will help connect these people.

User Profile
Target audience: Environmentalists! People who are very passionate about making the world greener and cleaner. I hope to have a user base that is very active and will always check on the area they are around and report any environmental problems.

To be decided. Will need some online database persistence for example Google Firebase server to track what all the locations and images that my users have saved in the app.
